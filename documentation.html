      <p>Your Discord Verifier has now been configured!</p>
      <p>If you got this link from an email, you will have been given two
        important pieces of text:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Your Short Code</b>: this is the "name" of your server on this
          verifier. For instance, it might be "csesoc". It will be in every
          URL you have access to on this site.</li>
        <li><b>Your Admin Key</b>: all data stored on this site is encrypted,
          which makes it very secure. To access the data, you will need to enter
          this key. <strong>Keep it secret</strong>, as it (along with your zID/zPass)
          is all that is needed to access your club's sign-in data.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are two pages that are now available to you:</p>
      <h2>The Verification Page</h2>
      <p>
        URL:
        https://web.cse.unsw.edu.au/~apps/discord/(your_short_code)/
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is for anyone wishing to join your server. Direct them here
        from a public channel, or in your marketing for your server.
      </p>
      <p>
        They will be asked to input a zID, zPass, their discord username, and
        then to accept your server rules (as well as Arc's rules).
      </p>
      <p>
        You should confirm now that this setup works as expected. If you have
        any issues, please contact <a href="mailto:apps.discord@cse.unsw.edu.au">apps.discord@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>
      </p>
      <h2>The Admin Page</h2>
      <p>
        Lhe admin page:
        https://web.cse.unsw.edu.au/~apps/discord/(your_short_code)/admin.html
      </p>
      <p>
        When you login, you can configure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Discord Server ID</li>
        <li>The name of the role to grant on verification</li>
        <li>Up to two admin zIDs (see below)</li>
        <li>Your Server Brand (the text that appears at the top of the registration page)</li>
        <li>Your Server Rules (the text that appears when a student is asked to accept your rules)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also see a list of students who have signed up, and what their zIDs are.
      </p>
      <p>
        When editing the Server Brand and Rules, you will need to use HTML
        syntax. This makes it very powerful, but it may be difficult to use if
        you've never used HTML before. Use a site like <a href="https://onlinehtmleditor.dev/">this one</a>
        to convert the starter information to something human readable,
        and back again! If you have questions, please
        contact <a href="mailto:apps.discord@cse.unsw.edu.au">apps.discord@cse.unsw.edu.au</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Only people whose zIDs are listed as admins or who are Arc Staff are
        able to access the admin page.
      </p>
      <h2>Common Troubleshooting Issues</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>Ensure that the "Discord Verifier" role is above the "Verified" role in your server! If it's not, the bot will not work.</li>
	  </ul>
      <p>
        If you have any issues getting the server to work, please contact
        <a href="mailto:apps.discord@cse.unsw.edu.au">apps.discord</a>
        and we will attempt to resolve your issue.
